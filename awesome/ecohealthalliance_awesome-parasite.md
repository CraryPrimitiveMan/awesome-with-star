Awesome Parasite [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
=========

> A curated list of amazingly awesome information and open-access databases related to parasites and host-pathogen interactions. 

Parasites are unique organisms studied in a variety of disciplines due to their health burden, diversity, and complex ecologies. 

Awesome parasite was created by [Anna Willoughby](https://arw36.github.io/) and is maintained in partnership with [EcoHealth Alliance](www.ecohealthalliance.org). Contributions welcome, please read the [contributing guidelines](contributing.md).

 * [Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI)](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/data.html) - A species interaction repository that can be searched by 'parasite of', 'pathogen of', or 'host of'.
 * [DBatVir](www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir) - A bat virus database curated from Genbank with host traits and summaries by location.
 * [DRodVir](http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DRodVir/) - A rodent virus database curated from Genbank with host traits.
 * [PHI-base](http://www.phi-base.org/index.jsp) - A database with information on specific genes of fungal, Oomycete and bacterial pathogens that affect pathogenicity. Focused on agricultural and medical pathogens of importance. 

## Museums & Collections
* [Denver Museum of Nature and Science](https://science.dmns.org/integrative-collections/dmns-zoology-collections/) - Collection of mammalian ecto- and endo- parasites primarily focused on the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains regions. Accessible through [Arctos](http://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenSearch.cfm). 
* [Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology Collection](http://hwml.unl.edu/resources/database-68) - Specimen collection focused "on the helminth parasites of mammals of the Nearctic and Neotropical regions stressing studies of the phylogeny and diversity of parasites of Rodentia, Marsupialia, Xenarthra, and Chiroptera." The archive site for the [American Society of Parasitologists](https://www.amsocparasit.org/). Accessible through [Arctos](http://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenSearch.cfm).

Particular focus on parasites of small mammals in high altidude locations and Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research Station in New Mexico, and parasites of seabirds in the artic and Antartica. Accessible through [Arctos](http://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenSearch.cfm). 
* [The International Outbreak Museum](http://www.outbreakmuseum.com) - Museum focused on human food-borne outbreaks, with each [exhibit](http://www.outbreakmuseum.com/exhibits/) being a different historical outbreak. Part of [The Northwest Center for Foodborne Outbreak Management, Epidemiology, and Surveillance](https://health.oregonstate.edu/fomes).
