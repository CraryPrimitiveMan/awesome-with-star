## Learning Material

 - **Redux's concepts**

    [Redux official documentation](http://redux.js.org/) does a great job at explaining Redux's core principles.

 - **Why immutable data structures**

    The [guide on performance](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html) of React's official documentation explains well what immutable data structures are and why they play an important role.

 - **Side Effects**

    [Redux Loop's readme](https://github.com/redux-loop/redux-loop) gives a good insight on Side Effects in the context of Redux.

Reading the aforementioned material will get you a good start for writing apps with Redux.

 - **Functional Programming - Basics**

    This [post](http://jaysoo.ca/2016/01/13/functional-programming-little-ideas/) goes over basic concepts of functional programming while building a YouTube instant search demo app.

 - **Reactive Programming**

    This [introduction to Reactive Programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) explains Reactive Programming with clarity.

 - **Functional Programming - Going beyond**

    Well written [article](https://medium.com/@chetcorcos/functional-programming-for-javascript-people-1915d8775504) that talks about interesting computer science concepts implemented in functional languages and how these apply to JavaScript.
