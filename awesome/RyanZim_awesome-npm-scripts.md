## Cross-platform Shell Reference

A quick reference of the shell operators & commands that work the same on Unix and Windows.

- `&&` runs commands in sequence. If a command fails, the script exits.
- `|` pipes the stdout of one command into the stdin of the next. (`do-something | something else`)
- `>` writes the stdout of a command to a file. (`do-something > file`)
- `<` sends the contents of a file to a command's stdin. (`command < file`)
- `cd <dir>` changes the current working directory to `<dir>`. Note that `cd` alone prints the current working directory on windows, but changes the working directory to `~` on \*nix.

## `npm run` Reference

You can use `npm run-script` or `npm run`; they both do the same thing, but `npm run` is shorter.

- Run just `npm run` to print a list of scripts.
- Running `npm run script` (where `script` is the name of your script) will run `prescript`, `script`, and `postscript`; in that order.
  - You can't nest `pre` and `post` hooks (i.e. `preprescript` won't work).
- You can pass arguments to your scripts by passing `--` to `npm run`, followed by the arguments. Example: Given the script `"mocha": "mocha"`, you can run `npm run mocha -- --reporter xunit`. This effectively runs `mocha --reporter xunit`.
- Running `npm test` is the same as running `npm run test`. The same applies to `npm start` and `npm stop`.
- You can run `npm run <script> -s` to silence the default npm output (useful for calling a script within another script).
