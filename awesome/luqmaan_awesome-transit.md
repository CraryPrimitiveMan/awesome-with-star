### Getting started

If this is your first time dealing with transit data, you might find these links useful:

- [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) - A GTFS feed is a group of text files that contains infrequently changing transit data, like stops, routes, trips, and other schedule data. Transit agencies typically update their GTFS feed every few months.
- [GTFS Realtime](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) - GTFS Realtime consists of three binary files that contain realtime vehicle positions, realtime arrival information, and service alerts. Transit agencies typically update these files every minute.
- [TransitFeeds](https://transitfeeds.com/) - List of GTFS/GTFS-realtime data feeds from around the world. If you're trying to get realtime data for some agency, this is a good place to start.
