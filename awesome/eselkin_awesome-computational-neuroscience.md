[Computational neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) is a multidisciplinary science that joins biology/neuroscience, medicine, biophysics, psychology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics to study the nervous system using computational approaches. 

This list of schools and researchers in computational neuroscience, theoretical neuroscience, (and systems neuroscience) aims to give a global perspective of researchers in the field, make it easier to apply to the listed institutions, and also provide a reasonable way to find an advisor.

In addition to names of PIs, excerpts of their academic biographies, and links to their publications, many of the researchers are qualified with a small scale "+/=/- computational." The metric is subjective to the editor of that material but it generally breaks down as: (+) refers to a researcher the university identifies as a computational neuroscientist, their bio consistently identifies a significant component of their research is in the field, and they have a significant body of work in the field. (=) refers to the fact that the university identifies them as practicing computational research and they have occasionally produced articles in the field. (-) means that the university identifies them as practicing computational neuroscience, their bio might also mention it, but I could not find articles of which they are an author that focus on the subject.

| Cheng, Sen | Our first approach is modeling, including mathematic models as well as computer simulation of complex networks. While all models are simplified, we aim to build biologically realistic models that capture the essence of the neural circuit mechanism underlying learning and memory. Our second approach is data-mining. We develop methods for model-based data analysis and apply such methods to experimental data. These data include electrophysiological and EEG recordings as well as behavioral data. We collaborate closely with neuroscientists on the RUB campus and at other universities in Germany and abroad. | [Lab](https://www.ini.rub.de/the_institute/people/sen-cheng/#publications) | +                   |

| Treves, Alessandro | [Hippocampal Processing: The aim is to understand how the hippocampus contributes to memory, focusing on modelling coding strategies within each structure of the hippocampal formation (e.g. self-organization of grid representations), as well as interactions between different structures. Neural Basis of Language: The aim is to describe network behaviour that could subserve Language production. A class of reduced Potts models of large semantic associative networks, endowed with adaptation, naturally displays Latching dynamics, i.e. hopping from one attractor to the next. Such dynamics may be associated with a network capacity for infinite recursion, which is considered as the core of several higher cognitive functions.](https://people.sissa.it/~ale/limbo.html) | [Google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=I2Y8X5AAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) | +                   |

To answer this question, our group combines optogenetics, pharmacology and behavioral manipulations with high-density tetrode and depth-probe recordings of neural activity in awake behaving rats. We are most interested in areas known as the hippocampus, medial septum, and entorhinal cortex which have all been shown to play important roles in memory in humans and animals. We use computational modeling to bridge this experimental work and human memory processing.

| Stuphorn, Veit | [I am interested in the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie decision-making and self-control, two essential functions of higher executive processes. To this end, in my lab we record the activity of single neurons in awake animals that are engaged in decision-making. This allows us to identify the types of signals that neurons in specific parts of the brain represent and the computations they carry out. I will also study human subjects in the same tasks with the help of fMRI. These parallel experiments will provide comparative information about decision processes in human and non-human primates.](http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/86/) | [Google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3C3nTXwAAAAJ&hl=en) | +                   |

| Bear, Mark        | [Our overarching interest is in the question of how experience and deprivation modify synaptic connections in the brain. Experience-dependent synaptic plasticity is the physical substrate of memory, sculpts connections during postnatal development to determine the capabilities and limitations of brain functions, is responsible for the reorganization of the brain after damage, and is vulnerable in numerous psychiatric and neurological diseases and contributes to their symptoms.](https://picower.mit.edu/mark-bear)                                                                                                                                                                               | [Google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xobgmhgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) | +                   |

His team uses a combination of large-scale neurophysiology, brain imaging, direct neural perturbation methods, and machine learning methods to build and test neurally-mechanistic computational models of the ventral visual stream and its support of cognition and behavior.](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/james-dicarlo/) | [Google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qenoZwUAAAAJ)                                   | +                   |

In one current project, we are studying nucleus RA, an area that projects directly to motor neurons of the vocal organ. During song, RA neurons each generate a distinctive and reproducible sequence of brief bursts of spikes. Using a new miniature motorized microdrive developed in this lab (see below), we have been able to record from large populations of RA neurons (~50) in the singing bird to understand how premotor activity maps to vocal output.](http://web.mit.edu/feelab/)                                                                     | [Google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nelvBCQAAAAJ&hl=en)                                   | +                   |
