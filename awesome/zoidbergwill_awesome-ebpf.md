> A curated list of awesome projects related to eBPF.

BPF, as in _Berkeley Packet Filter_, is an in-kernel virtual machine running programs passed from user space. Initially implemented on BSD, then Linux, the (now legacy) "classic BPF" or cBPF machine would be used with tools like tcpdump for filtering packets in the kernel to avoid useless copies to user space. More recently, the BPF infrastructure in Linux has been completely reworked and gave life to the "extended BPF", or eBPF, which gained new features (safety and termination checks, JIT-compiling for programs, persistent maps, a standard library, hardware offload support, etc.) and is now used for many tasks. Processing packets at a very low level (XDP), tracing and monitoring events on the system, or enforcing access control over cgroups are but a few examples to which eBPF brings performance, programmability and flexibility.

> Note: eBPF is an exciting piece of technology, and its ecosystem is constantly evolving. We'd love help from _you_ to keep this awesome list up to date, and improve its signal-to-noise ratio in anyway we can. Please feel free to leave [any feedback](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/awesome-ebpf/issues).

## The Code

- [linux/include/linux/bpf.h](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/bpf.h) - with [linux/include/uapi/bpf.h](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h): definitions related to eBPF, to be used respectively in the kernel and to interface with userspace programs.
- [linux/include/linux/filter.h](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/filter.h) - with [linux/include/uapi/filter.h](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/uapi/linux/filter.h): information used to run the BPF programs themselves.
- [linux/kernel/bpf/](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/bpf) - This directory contains most of BPF-related code. In particular, those files are worth of interest:

  - [`syscall.c`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/bpf/syscall.c) - Different operations permitted by the system call, such as program loading or map management.
  - [`core.c`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/bpf/core.c) - BPF interpreter.
  - [`verifier.c`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/bpf/verifier.c) - BPF verifier.

- [linux/net/core/filter.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/core/filter.c) - Functions and eBPF helpers related to networking (TC, XDP etc.); also contains the code to migrate cBPF bytecode to eBPF (all cBPF programs are translated to eBPF in recent kernels).
- [linux/kernel/trace/bpf_trace.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/trace/bpf_trace.c) - Functions and eBPF helpers related to tracing and monitoring (kprobes, tracepoints, etc.).
- The JIT compilers are under the directory of their respective architectures, such as file [linux/arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c) for x86\. Exception is made for JIT compilers used for hardware offload, sitting in their drivers, such as [linux/drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/bpf/jit.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/bpf/jit.c) for Netronome NFP.
- [linux/net/sched/](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/sched) - and in particular in files `act_bpf.c` (action) and `cls_bpf.c` (filter): code related to BPF actions and filters with TC.
- [linux/kernel/seccomp.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/seccomp.c)
- [linux/net/core/dev.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/core/dev.c) - contains the function `dev_change_xdp_fd()` that is called through a Netlink command to hook a XDP program to a device, after is has been loaded into the kernel from user space. This function in turns uses a callback from the relevant driver.
