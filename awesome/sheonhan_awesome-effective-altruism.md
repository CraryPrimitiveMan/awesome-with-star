# Awesome Effective Altruism [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of everything related to [Effective Altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism)—a philosophy that uses scientific evidence and rigorous quantitative reasoning to take the most effective approach to doing philanthropy.

As described by [the Center for Effective Altruism](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/what-is-effective-altruism/), "Effective altruism is about using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis."

**Effective Altruism is awesome in the original sense of the word "awesome"**—it's awe-inspiring and empowering to think how much one individual can make a positive impact in the world with the right approach. :muscle:

Infused with the spirit of scientific rigor and the ethos of improving the world, Effective Altruism is making such endeavors even more potent. :rocket:

Well-intentioned altruists have been shadowboxing against some of the knottiest problems. Usually, the world doesn't need more "-isms," but Effective Altruism may be the closest thing to a philanthropic revolution. :point_up:

The passion in this nascent community is so palpable:fire:. **I believe it behooves us developers to create projects, tools, data visualizations, etc., that could help this world suffer a little less.** :earth_africa:
