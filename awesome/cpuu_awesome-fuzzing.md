> [Fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks. Typically, fuzzers are used to test programs that take structured inputs. 

A curated list of references to awesome Fuzzing for security testing. Additionally there is a collection of freely available academic papers, tools and so on.

It includes (i) Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), (ii) IEEE Symposium on
Security and Privacy (S&P), (iii) USENIX Security Symposium (USEC), and (iv) ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS).
