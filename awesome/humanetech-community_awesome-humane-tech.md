## About this list

Tech and social media is having a big impact on our society. While many innovative technology inventions are improving our lives, there is increasing awareness on negative impacts that come with these trends, such as social media addiction, mental health issues, and social erosion. To address [these problems](https://humanetech.com/problem/), a world-class team of deeply concerned former tech insiders led by Tristan Harris have created [The Center of Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com).


This list focuses on (mostly open-source) projects that are directly related to humane tech topics. Please read the [guidelines for contributing](contributing.md) before sending your PR's.
